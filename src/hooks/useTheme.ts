/**
 * DEPRECATED PLACEHOLDER HOOK - DO NOT REMOVE
 * 
 * This hook was kept as a placeholder after refactoring to dark-only mode.
 * Purpose: Prevents breaking imports while migration is complete.
 * 
 * The app is now dark mode only. This hook always returns darkMode: true.
 * 
 * KEEP THIS FILE: Even though unused, it maintains import compatibility.
 * If removing in future, search codebase first for any remaining imports.
